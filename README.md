# WatchOSX

I am working on a project I can WatchOSX which will hope to make a 3d printed
watch that runs on the Seeeduino XIAO and a 0.96 inch oled. In this repo you
will be able to find all the code and STL files for the watch and I hope to make
documentation on how you can also make your own watch.
